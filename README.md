manUp (or at least Google it)
=============================

This ghidra script will open the manual page of the function found at the current selected address.
If manual page cannot be found for the specific function, the script will initiate a search query to Google.

Usage/Customize
---------------

Change the *BROWSER* and the *TERMINAL* variables at the beginning of the script to your preferred browser/terminal emulator.

By default the *SHIFT-G* hotkey is used for the lookup, you can change it to whatevs at the header section of the script.

Thats all you have to be careful of, just add it to your ghidra scripts and you can open up those man's faster than Jason.
